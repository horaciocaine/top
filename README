This is the source code for the Swift Mailer Web Site at swiftmailer.org.

If you really want to install it on your own server:

  1. Checkout the source from git
  2. Create a blank database with some known credentials
  3. Copy application/config/environment.ini.default to application/config/environment.ini
  4. Copy application/config/db.ini.default to application/config/db.ini
  5. Edit application/config/db.ini to reference your database
  6. Run the script (from the command line) application/scripts/install.php
  7. Make sure the site will be running at the root directory of the domain (i.e. at /)
  8. Point your document root in apache to the htdocs folder

A root user will be created for you that you can log in as at http://your-site.tld/admin.

  Username: admin
  Password: everest

You can change this password when you first log in.

Feel free to browse and nosey around.  You'll find Swift Mailer integrated
throughout the code base.
