      <p>
    You can seek advice at Google Groups, within the "swiftmailer" group.
  </p>

      <p>
      Swift Mailer has a mailing list at Google Groups:
      <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/swiftmailer">http://groups.google.com/group/swiftmailer</a>
      </p>

      <p>
      You can post messages to this group if you want help, or there's something you
      wish to discuss with the developers and with other users.
    </p>

      <p>
      This is probably the fastest way to get help since it is primarily email-based for
      most users, though bug reports should not be posted here since they may not be
      resolved.
