            <br/>
Sending a message is very straightforward. You create a Transport, use it to create the Mailer, then you use the Mailer to send the message.</li>

A Transport is the component which actually does the sending. You need to provide a Transport object to the Mailer class and there are several possible options.</li>

It's possible to get a list of addresses that were rejected by the Transport by using a by-reference parameter to send() or batchSend().</li>
