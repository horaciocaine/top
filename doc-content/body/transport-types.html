      <p>
    A Transport is the component which actually does the sending.  You need to provide
    a Transport object to the Mailer class and there are several possible options.

        Typically you will not need to know how a Transport works under-the-surface, you will only need
        to know how to create an instance of one, and which one to use for your environment.
