  <h1 class="topictitle1">Setting the Filename</h1>

  
  
  <div>
      <p>
    Usually you don't need to explicitly set the filename of an attachment because
    the name of the attached file will be used by default, but if you want to set the
    filename you use the setFilename() method of the Attachment.
  </p>

      <div class="section">
         <p>
        To change the filename of an attachment:
      </p>

      </div>

    
      <div class="p">
        <span>
          Call its <samp class="codeph">setFilename()</samp> method.
        </span>
      </div>

    
    
      <div class="section">
         <p>
        The attachment will be attached in the normal way, but meta-data sent inside
        the email will rename the file to something else.
      </p>

      </div>

    
      <div class="example" id="setting-filename__setfilename">
         <pre class="codeblock">
//Create the attachment and call its setFilename() method
$attachment = Swift_Attachment::fromPath('/path/to/image.jpg')
  -&gt;setFilename('cool.jpg');


//Because there's a fluid interface, you can do this in one statement
$message-&gt;attach(
  Swift_Attachment::fromPath('/path/to/image.jpg')-&gt;setFilename('cool.jpg')
);
