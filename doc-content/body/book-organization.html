  <div>
      <p>
    This book has been written so that those who need information quickly are able
    to find what they need, and those who wish to learn more advanced topics can
    read deeper into each chapter.
  </p>

      <p>
      The book begins with an overview of Swift Mailer, discussing what's included
      in the package and preparing you for the remainder of the book.
    </p>

      <p>
      It is possible to read this user guide just like any other book (from beginning
      to end). Each chapter begins with a discussion of the contents it contains, followed
      by a short code sample designed to give you a head start.  As you get further
      into a chapter you will learn more about Swift Mailer's capabilities, but often
      you will be able to head directly to the topic you wish to learn about.
    </p>

      <p>
      Throughout this book you will be presented with code samples, which
      most people should find ample to implement Swift Mailer appropriately in their
      own projects.  I will also use diagrams where appropriate, and where I believe
      readers may find it helpful I will discuss some related theory, including reference
      to certain documents you are able to find online.
