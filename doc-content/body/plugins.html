    Plugins are provided with Swift Mailer and can be used to extend the
    behavior of the library in ways that simple class inheritance would be
    more complex.

            <br/>
Many SMTP servers have limits on the number of messages that may be sent during any single SMTP connection. The AntiFlood plugin provides a way to stay within this limit while still managing a large number of emails.</li>
         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="throttler-plugin">Throttler Plugin</a>
            <br/>
If your SMTP server has restrictions in place to limit the rate at which you send emails, then your code will need to be aware of this rate-limiting. The Throttler plugin makes Swift Mailer run at a rate-limited speed.</li>
         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="logger-plugin">Logger Plugin</a>
            <br/>
The Logger plugins helps with debugging during the process of sending. It can help to identify why an SMTP server is rejecting addresses, or any other hard-to-find problems that may arise.</li>
