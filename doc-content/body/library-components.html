  <div>
      <p>
    Swift Mailer is made up of many classes.  Each of these classes can be grouped into a
    general "component" group which describes the task it is designed to perform.
  </p>

      <p>
      We'll take a brief look at the components which form Swift Mailer in this section of the book.

         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="mailer-component">The Mailer</a>
            <br/>
The mailer class, Swift_Mailer is the central class in the library where all of the other components meet one another. Swift_Mailer acts as a sort of message dispatcher, communicating with the underlying Transport to deliver your Message to all intended recipients.</li>
         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="transport-components">Transports</a>
            <br/>
Transports are the classes in Swift Mailer that are responsible for communicating with a service in order to deliver a Message. There are several types of Transport in Swift Mailer, all of which implement the Swift_Transport interface and offer underlying start(), stop() and send() methods.</li>
         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="mime-components">MIME Entities</a>
            <br/>
Everything that forms part of a Message is called a MIME Entity. All MIME entities in Swift Mailer share a common set of features. There are various types of MIME entity that serve different purposes such as Attachments and MIME parts.</li>
         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="encoder-components">Encoders</a>
            <br/>
Encoders are used to transform the content of Messages generated in Swift Mailer into a format that is safe to send across the internet and that conforms to RFC specifications.</li>
         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="plugin-components">Plugins</a>
            <br/>
Plugins exist to extend, or modify the behaviour of Swift Mailer. They respond to Events that are fired within the Transports during sending.</li>
      </ol>

Historically, Swift Mailer has supported both PHP 4 and PHP 5 by following a parallel development workflow. Now in it's fourth major version, and with PHP 4 support officially dropped by its makers at Zend, Swift Mailer operates on servers running PHP 5.2 or higher.">System Requirements</a>
