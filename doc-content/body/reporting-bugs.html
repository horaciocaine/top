      <p>
    Bugs and feature requests should be posted on Lighthouse.
  </p>

      <p>
      If you post a bug or request a feature in the forum, or on the Google Group you will most
      likely be asked to create a ticket in Lighthouse since it is the simply not feasible to
      manage such requests from a number of a different sources.
    </p>

      <p>
      The following link is for the Lighthouse project page:
      <a href="http://swiftmailer.lighthouseapp.com/">http://swiftmailer.lighthouseapp.com/</a>
      </p>

    
      <br/>

      <br/>
    
      <p>
      When you go to Lighthouse you will be asked to create a username and password before you can
      create a ticket.  This is free and takes very little time.
    </p>

      <p>
      When you create your ticket, do not assign it to any milestones.  A developer will assess your
      ticket and re-assign it as needed.
    </p>

      <p>
      If your ticket is reporting a bug present in the current version, which was not present in the
      previous version please include the tag "regression" in your ticket.
    </p>

      <p>
      Lighthouse will update you when work is performed on your ticket.
