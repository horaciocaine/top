      <p>
    The mailer class, <samp class="codeph">Swift_Mailer</samp> is the central class in the library where all of the
    other components meet one another. <samp class="codeph">Swift_Mailer</samp> acts as a sort of message dispatcher,
    communicating with the underlying Transport to deliver your Message to all intended
    recipients.
  </p>

      <div class="p">
      If you were to dig around in the source code for Swift Mailer you'd notice that <samp class="codeph">Swift_Mailer</samp>
      itself is pretty bare.  It delegates to other objects for most tasks and in theory, if you knew the internals
      of Swift Mailer well you could by-pass this class entirely.  We wouldn't advise doing such a thing however â€“
      there are reasons this class exists:
      <br/>
         <ul>
            <li>for consistency, regardless of the Transport used</li>

            <li>to provide abstraction from the internals in the event internal API changes are made</li>

            <li>to provide convenience wrappers around aspects of the internal API</li>

         </ul>

      </div>

      <p>
      An instance of <samp class="codeph">Swift_Mailer</samp> is created by the developer before sending any Messages.
