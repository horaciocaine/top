  <h1 class="topictitle1">Adding Recipients to Your Message</h1>

  
  
  <div>
      <p>
    Recipients are specified within the message itself via setTo(), setCc() and setBcc().
    Swift Mailer reads these recipients from the message when it gets sent so that it knows
    where to send the message to.
  </p>

      <div class="section" id="message-recipients__about">
         <div class="p">
        Message recipients are one of three types:
        <br/>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <samp class="codeph">To:</samp> recipients – the primary recipients (required)</li>

               <li>
                  <samp class="codeph">Cc:</samp> recipients – receive a copy of the message (optional)</li>

               <li>
                  <samp class="codeph">Bcc:</samp> recipients – hidden from other recipients (optional)</li>

            </ol>

         </div>

         <p>
        Each type can contain one, or several addresses.  It's possible to list only
        the addresses of the recipients, or you can personalize the address by providing
        the real name of the recipient.
      </p>

      </div>

    
      <div class="section">
         <h2 class="sectiontitle">Syntax for Addresses</h2>
      
         <p>
        If you only wish to refer to a single email address (for example your <samp class="codeph">From:</samp>
        address) then you can just use a string.
      </p>

         <pre class="kodify php">
$message-&gt;setFrom('some@address.tld');
</pre>


         <p>
        If you want to include a name then you must use an associative array.
      </p>

         <pre class="kodify php">
$message-&gt;setFrom(array('some@address.tld' =&gt; 'The Name'));
</pre>


         <p>
        If you want to include multiple addresses then you must use an array.
      </p>

         <pre class="kodify php">
$message-&gt;setTo(array('some@address.tld', 'other@address.tld'));
</pre>


         <p>
        You can mix personalized (addresses with a name) and non-personalized
        addresses in the same list by mixing the use of associative and non-associative
        array syntax.
      </p>


         <pre class="kodify php">
$message-&gt;setTo(array(
  'recipient-with-name@example.org' =&gt; 'Recipient Name One',
  'no-name@example.org', //Note that this is not a key-value pair
  'named-recipient@example.org' =&gt; 'Recipient Name Two'
));
</pre>

      
      </div>

    
  </div>

   <div>
      <ol>
         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="recipients-to">Setting To: Recipients</a>
            <br/>
To: recipients are required in a message and are set with the setTo() method of the message.</li>
         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="recipients-cc">Setting Cc: Recipients</a>
            <br/>
Cc: recipients receive a copy of the message and are set with the setCc() method of the message.</li>
         <li class="olchildlink">
            <a href="recipients-bcc">Setting Bcc: Recipients</a>
            <br/>
Bcc: recipients receive a copy of the message without anybody else knowing it, and are set with the setBcc() method of the message.</li>
      </ol>
