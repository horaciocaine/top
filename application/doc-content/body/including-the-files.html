  <h1 class="topictitle1">Including Swift Mailer (Autoloading)</h1>

  
  
  <div>
<p>
    Swift Mailer uses an auto-loader so the only file you need to include is the
    <samp class="codeph">lib/swift_required.php</samp> file.
  </p>

    <p>
      To use Swift Mailer's autoloader:
    </p>

    
    <br/>
<ol>
      <li>
        Put Swift Mailer somewhere accessible to your PHP scripts (this does not need to be in the web root).
      </li>

      <li>
        Include, or require the <samp class="codeph">lib/swift_required.php</samp> file.
      </li>

      <li>
        Follow the remainder of the documentation for using the available components.
      </li>

    </ol>

    
    <div class="note">
<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
      While Swift Mailer's autoloader is designed to play nicely with other autoloaders,
      sometimes you may have a need to avoid using Swift Mailer's autoloader and use your own
      instead.  Include the <samp class="codeph">swift_init.php</samp> instead of the <samp class="codeph">swift_required.php</samp>
      if you need to do this.  The very minimum include is the <samp class="codeph">swift_init.php</samp> file since
      Swift Mailer will not work without the dependency injection this file sets up.
