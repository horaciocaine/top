  <h1 class="topictitle1">Specifying Sender Details</h1>

  
  
  <div>
<p>
    An email must include information about who sent it.  Usually this is managed
    by the <samp class="codeph">From:</samp> address, however there are other options.
  </p>

    <div class="section" id="message-senders__about">
      <div class="p">
        The sender information is contained in three possible places:
        <br/>
<ol>
          <li>
<samp class="codeph">From:</samp> – the address(es) of who wrote the message (required)</li>

          <li>
<samp class="codeph">Sender:</samp> – the address of the single person who sent the message (optional)</li>

          <li>
<samp class="codeph">Return-Path:</samp> – the address where bounces should go to (optional)</li>

        </ol>

      </div>

      <p>
        You must always include a <samp class="codeph">From:</samp> address by using <samp class="codeph">setFrom()</samp> on the
        message.  Swift Mailer will use this as the default <samp class="codeph">Return-Path:</samp> unless otherwise
        specified.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <samp class="codeph">Sender:</samp> address exists because the person who actually sent the email may not be the
        person who wrote the email.  It has a higher precedence than the <samp class="codeph">From:</samp> address and will be
        used as the <samp class="codeph">Return-Path:</samp> unless otherwise specified.
      </p>

    </div>

    
    <div class="section">
<h2 class="sectiontitle">Syntax for Addresses</h2>
      
      <p>
        If you only wish to refer to a single email address (for example your <samp class="codeph">From:</samp>
        address) then you can just use a string.
      </p>

<pre class="kodify php">
$message-&gt;setFrom('some@address.tld');
</pre>


      <p>
        If you want to include a name then you must use an associative array.
      </p>

<pre class="kodify php">
$message-&gt;setFrom(array('some@address.tld' =&gt; 'The Name'));
</pre>


      <p>
        If you want to include multiple addresses then you must use an array.
      </p>

<pre class="kodify php">
$message-&gt;setTo(array('some@address.tld', 'other@address.tld'));
</pre>


      <p>
        You can mix personalized (addresses with a name) and non-personalized
        addresses in the same list by mixing the use of associative and non-associative
        array syntax.
      </p>


<pre class="kodify php">
$message-&gt;setTo(array(
  'recipient-with-name@example.org' =&gt; 'Recipient Name One',
  'no-name@example.org', //Note that this is not a key-value pair
  'named-recipient@example.org' =&gt; 'Recipient Name Two'
));
</pre>
