  <div>
<p>
    The length of lines in a message can be changed by using the <samp class="codeph">setMaxLineLength()</samp>
    method on the message.  It should be kept to less than 1000 characters.
  </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Swift Mailer defaults to using 78 characters per line in a message.  This is done
        for historical reasons and so that the message can be easily viewed in plain-text
        terminals.
      </p>

      <p>
        To change the maximum length of lines in your Message:
      </p>

    </div>

    
      <div class="p">
        <span>
          Call the <samp class="codeph">setMaxLineLength()</samp> method on the Message.
        </span>
      </div>

    
    
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Lines that are longer than the line length specified will be wrapped
        between words.
      </p>

      <div class="note">
<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        You should never set a maximum length longer than 1000 characters according
        to RFC 2822.  Doing so could have unspecified side-effects such as truncating
        parts of your message when it is transported between SMTP servers.
