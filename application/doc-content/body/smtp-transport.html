      <p>
    The SMTP Transport sends messages over the (standardized) Simple Message Transfer
    Protocol.  It can deal with encryption and authentication.

        The SMTP Transport, <samp class="codeph">Swift_SmtpTransport</samp> is without doubt the most commonly
        used Transport because it will work on 99% of web servers.<a name="fnsrc_1" href="#fntarg_1">
               <sup>[1]</sup>
            </a> All the server
        needs is the ability to connect to a remote (or even local) SMTP server on
        the correct port number (usually 25).
      </p>

         <p>
        SMTP servers often require users to authenticate with a username and password
        before any mail can be sent to other domains.  This is easily achieved using
        Swift Mailer with the SMTP Transport.
      </p>

         <p>
        SMTP is a protocol – in other words it's a "way" of communicating a job
        to be done (i.e. sending a message).  The SMTP protocol is the fundamental
        basis on which messages are delivered all over the internet 7 days a week,
        365 days a year.  For this reason it's the most "direct" method of sending
        messages you can use and it's the one that will give you the most power and
        feedback (such as delivery failures) when using Swift Mailer.
      </p>

         <p>
        Because SMTP is generally run as a remote service (i.e. you connect to it
        over the network/internet) it's extremely portable from server-to-server.  You
        can easily store the SMTP server address and port number in a configuration file
        within your application and adjust the settings accordingly if the code is moved
        or if the SMTP server is changed.
      </p>

         <p>
        Some SMTP servers – Google for example – use encryption for security
        reasons.  Swift Mailer supports using both SSL and TLS encryption settings.
