  <h1 class="topictitle1">MIME Entities</h1>

  
  
  <div>
      <p>
    Everything that forms part of a Message is called a MIME Entity.  All MIME entities
    in Swift Mailer share a common set of features.  There are various types of MIME entity
    that serve different purposes such as Attachments and MIME parts.
  </p>

      <div class="section" id="mime__mimebasics">
         <p>
        An e-mail message is made up of several relatively simple entities that are combined in
        different ways to achieve different results.  All of these entities have the same fundamental
        outline but serve a different purpose.  The Message itself can be defined as a MIME entity,
        an Attachment is a MIME entity, all MIME parts are MIME entities – and so on…
      </p>

         <div class="p">
        The basic units of each MIME entity – be it the Message itself, or an Attachment –
        are its Headers and its body:
      
<pre class="kodify">Header-Name: A header value
Other-Header: Another value

The body content itself</pre>

      
         </div>

         <p>
        The Headers of a MIME entity, and its body must conform to some strict standards defined by
        various RFC documents.  Swift Mailer ensures that these specifications are followed by using
        various types of object, including Encoders and different Header types to generate the entity.

      <div class="section">
         <p>
        Each MIME component implements the base <samp class="codeph">Swift_Mime_MimeEntity</samp> interface, which
        offers methods for retrieving Headers, adding new Headers, changing the Encoder, updating
        the body and so on…
      </p>

      </div>

      <div class="section" id="mime__mimenote">
         <p>
        All MIME entities have one Header in common – the Content-Type Header, updated with
        the entity's <samp class="codeph">setContentType()</samp> method.
      </p>
