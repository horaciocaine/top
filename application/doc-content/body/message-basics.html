  <div>
<p>
    A message is a container for anything you want to send to somebody else.  There are
    several basic aspects of a message that you should know.
  </p>

    
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        An e-mail message is made up of several relatively simple entities that are combined in
        different ways to achieve different results.  All of these entities have the same fundamental
        outline but serve a different purpose.  The Message itself can be defined as a MIME entity,
        an Attachment is a MIME entity, all MIME parts are MIME entities – and so on…
      </p>

      <div class="p">
        The basic units of each MIME entity – be it the Message itself, or an Attachment –
        are its Headers and its body:
      
<pre class="kodify">Header-Name: A header value
Other-Header: Another value

The body content itself</pre>

      
      </div>

      <p>
        The Headers of a MIME entity, and its body must conform to some strict standards defined by
        various RFC documents.  Swift Mailer ensures that these specifications are followed by using
        various types of object, including Encoders and different Header types to generate the entity.
      </p>

<h2 class="sectiontitle">The Structure of a Message</h2>
      
      
      <p>
        Of all of the MIME entities, a message – <samp class="codeph">Swift_Message</samp> is the
        largest and most complex.  It has many properties that can be updated and it can contain
        other MIME entities – attachments for example – nested inside it.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Message has a lot of different Headers which are there to present information about
        the message to the recipients' mail client.  Most of these headers will be familiar to
        the majority of users, but we'll list the basic ones.  Although it's possible to work
        directly with the Headers of a Message (or other MIME entity), the standard Headers have accessor
        methods provided to abstract away the complex details for you.  For example, although the Date
        on a message is written with a strict format, you only need to pass a UNIX timestamp to <samp class="codeph">setDate()</samp>.

<h2 class="sectiontitle">Working with a Message Object</h2>
      
      
      <p>
        Although there are a lot of available methods on a message object, you only need
        to make use of a small subset of them.  Usually you'll use <samp class="codeph">setSubject()</samp>,
        <samp class="codeph">setTo()</samp> and <samp class="codeph">setFrom()</samp> before setting the body of your
        message with <samp class="codeph">setBody()</samp>.
      </p>

      <div class="p">
        Calling methods is simple.  You just call them like functions, but using the object
        operator "<samp class="codeph">-&gt;</samp>" to do so.  If you've created a message object
        and called it <samp class="codeph">$message</samp> then you'd set a subject on it like so:
        
<pre class="kodify php">
&lt;?php

require_once 'lib/swift_required.php';  

$message = Swift_Message::newInstance();
$message-&gt;setSubject('My subject');

</pre>

      </div>

      
      <div class="p">
        All MIME entities (including a message) have a <samp class="codeph">toString()</samp> method that
        you can call if you want to take a look at what is going to be sent.  For example, if you
        <samp class="codeph">echo $message-&gt;toString();</samp> you would see something like this:
        
<pre class="kodify">
Message-ID: &lt;1230173678.4952f5eeb1432@swift.generated&gt;
Date: Thu, 25 Dec 2008 13:54:38 +1100
Subject: Example subject

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

Here is the message
</pre>
