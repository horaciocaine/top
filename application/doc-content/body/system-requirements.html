<p>
    The basic requirements to operate Swift Mailer are extremely minimal and easily achieved.
    Historically, Swift Mailer has supported both PHP 4 and PHP 5 by following a parallel
    development workflow.  Now in it's fourth major version, and with PHP 4 support officially
    dropped by its makers at Zend, Swift Mailer operates on servers
    running PHP 5.2 or higher.
  </p>

    <div class="p">
      The library aims to work with as many PHP 5 projects as possible:
      <br/>
<ul>
        <li>PHP 5.2 or higher, with the SPL extension (standard)</li>

        <li>Limited network access to connect to remote SMTP servers</li>

        <li>8 MB or more memory limit (Swift Mailer uses around 2 MB)</li>

      </ul>
