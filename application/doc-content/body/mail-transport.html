  <h1 class="topictitle1">The Mail Transport</h1>

  
  
  <div>
<p>
    The Mail Transport sends messages by delegating to PHP's internal <span class="cmdname">mail()</span>
    function.
  </p>

    <div class="section" id="transport-mail__about">
      <p>
        In my experience – and others' – the <samp class="codeph">mail()</samp>
        function is not particularly predictable, or helpful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quite notably, the <samp class="codeph">mail()</samp> function behaves entirely differently between Linux and
        Windows servers.  On linux it uses <span class="cmdname">sendmail</span>, but on Windows it uses SMTP.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order for the <samp class="codeph">mail()</samp> function to even work at all <span class="filepath">php.ini</span> needs to be configured
        correctly, specifying the location of sendmail or of an SMTP server.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem with <samp class="codeph">mail()</samp> is that it "tries" to simplify things to the point that it
        actually makes things more complex due to poor interface design.  The developers of
        Swift Mailer have gone to a lot of effort to make the Mail Transport work with a
        reasonable degree of consistency.

      <div class="p">
        Serious drawbacks when using this Transport are:
        <br/>
<ul>
          <li>Unpredictable message headers</li>

          <li>Lack of feedback regarding delivery failures</li>

          <li>Lack of support for several plugins that require real-time delivery feedback</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>
         It's a last resort, and we say that with a passion!

To use the Mail Transport you simply need to call Swift_MailTransport::newInstance(). It's unlikely you'll need to configure the Transport.</li>
