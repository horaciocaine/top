  <h1 class="topictitle1">ID Headers</h1>

  
  
  <div>
<p>
    ID headers contain identifiers for the entity (or the message).  The most notable
    ID header is the Message-ID header on the message itself.
  </p>

    <p>
      An ID that exists inside an ID header looks more-or-less less like an email
      address.  For example, <samp class="codeph">&lt;1234955437.499becad62ec2@example.org&gt;</samp>.
      The part to the left of the @ sign is usually unique, based on the current time and
      some random factor.  The part on the right is usually a domain name.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any ID passed the an ID header's <samp class="codeph">setId()</samp> method absolutely
      MUST conform to this structure, otherwise you'll get an Exception thrown at you
      by Swift Mailer (a <samp class="codeph">Swift_RfcComplianceException</samp>).  This is to
      ensure that the generated email complies with relevant RFC documents and therefore
      is less likely to be blocked as spam.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's easy to add a new ID header to a HeaderSet.  You do this by calling
      the HeaderSet's <samp class="codeph">addIdHeader()</samp> method.
    </p>

<pre class="kodify php">
&lt;?php

$message = Swift_Message::newInstance();

$headers = $message-&gt;getHeaders();

$headers-&gt;addIdHeader('Your-Header-Name', '123456.unqiue@example.org');

</pre>

    
    <p>
      Changing the value of an existing date header is done by calling its <samp class="codeph">setId()</samp>
      method.
    </p>

<pre class="kodify php">
&lt;?php

$msgId = $message-&gt;getHeaders()-&gt;getHeader('Message-ID');

$msgId-&gt;setId(time() . '.' . uniqid('thing') . '@example.org');

</pre>


    <p>
      When output via <samp class="codeph">toString()</samp>, an ID header produces something like the following:
    </p>

    
<pre class="kodify php">
&lt;?php

$msgId = $message-&gt;getHeaders()-&gt;getHeader('Message-ID');

echo $msgId-&gt;toString();

/*

Message-ID: &lt;1234955437.499becad62ec2@example.org&gt;

*/

</pre>
