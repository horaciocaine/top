  <h1 class="topictitle1">Setting the Body Content</h1>

  
  
  <div>
<p>
    The body of the message – seen when the user opens the message – is
    specified by calling the setBody() method.  If an alternative body is to be included
    addPart() can be used.
  </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The body of a message is the main part that is read by the user.  Often people
        want to send a message in HTML format (<samp class="codeph">text/html</samp>), other times
        people want to send in plain text (<samp class="codeph">text/plain</samp>), or sometimes people
        want to send both versions and allow the recipient to chose how they view the message.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a rule of thumb, if you're going to send a HTML email, always include a plain-text
        equivalent of the same content so that users who prefer to read plain text can do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        To set the body of your Message:
      </p>

    </div>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>
          Call the <samp class="codeph">setBody()</samp> method of the Message, or specify it
          at the time you create the message.
        </span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>
          Add any alternative bodies with <samp class="codeph">addPart()</samp>.
        </span>
      </li>

    </ol>

    
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        If the recipient's mail client offers preferences for displaying text vs. HTML then
        the mail client will present that part to the user where available.  In other cases
        the mail client will display the "best" part it can - usually HTML if you've included
        HTML.
      </p>
