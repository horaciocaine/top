    You can change the priority of the message with <samp class="codeph">setPriority()</samp>.  Setting the
    priority will not change the way your email is sent â€“ it is purely an indicative setting
    for the recipient.

        The priority of a message is an indication to the recipient what significance it has.
        Swift Mailer allows you to set the priority by calling the <samp class="codeph">setPriority</samp>
        method.  This method takes an integer value between 1 and 5:
        <br/>
            <ol>
               <li>Highest</li>

               <li>High</li>

               <li>Normal</li>

               <li>Low</li>

               <li>Lowest</li>

            </ol>

          method on the Message.
