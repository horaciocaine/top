  <h1 class="topictitle1">Finding out Rejected Addresses</h1>

  
  
  <div>
      <p>
    It's possible to get a list of addresses that were rejected by the Transport
    by using a by-reference parameter to <samp class="codeph">send()</samp> or <samp class="codeph">batchSend()</samp>.
  </p>

      <p>
      As Swift Mailer attempts to send the message to each address given to it, if a recipient
      is rejected it will be added to the array.  You can pass an existing array, otherwise one
      will be created by-reference.
    </p>

      <p>
      Collecting the list of recipients that were rejected can be useful in circumstances where
      you need to "prune" a mailing list for example when some addresses cannot be delivered to.

Collecting delivery failures by-reference with the send() or batchSend() methods is as simple as passing a variable name to the method call.</li>
