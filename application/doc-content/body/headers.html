    Sometimes you'll want to add your own headers to a message or modify/remove
    headers that are already present.  You work with the message's HeaderSet to
    do this.

Working with the headers in a message involves knowing how to use the methods on the HeaderSet and on the individual Headers within the HeaderSet.</li>
