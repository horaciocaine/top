  <h1 class="topictitle1">Setting <samp class="codeph">Bcc:</samp> Recipients</h1>

  
  
  <div>
<p>
    <samp class="codeph">Bcc:</samp> recipients receive a copy of the message without anybody
    else knowing it, and are set with the <samp class="codeph">setBcc()</samp> or
    <samp class="codeph">addBcc</samp> methods of the message.
  </p>

    <p>
      To set <samp class="codeph">Bcc:</samp> recipients, create the message object using either
      <samp class="codeph">new Swift_Message( ... )</samp> or <samp class="codeph">Swift_Message::newInstance( ... )</samp>,
      then call the <samp class="codeph">setBcc()</samp> method with a complete array of addresses, or use the
      <samp class="codeph">addBcc()</samp> method to iteratively add recipients.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      The <samp class="codeph">setBcc()</samp> method accepts input in various formats as described in the
      chapter, <a href="addresses" title="Addresses are specified with a basic array syntax that can include the name associated with the address.">Addresses in Swift Mailer</a>.  The <samp class="codeph">addBcc()</samp> method
      takes either one or two parameters.  The first being the email address and the second optional
      parameter being the name of the recipient.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      Only the individual <samp class="codeph">Bcc:</samp> recipient will see their address in
      the message headers.  Other recipients (including other <samp class="codeph">Bcc:</samp>
      recipients) will not see the address.
    </p>

    
    <div class="note">
<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
      You should not use <samp class="codeph">Bcc:</samp> recipients as a mechanism for sending
      bulk email with undisclosed recipients.  You should perform a <samp class="codeph">batchSend()</samp>
      instead.
    </div>

    
    <div class="note">
<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
      Multiple calls to <samp class="codeph">setBcc()</samp> will not add new recipients â€“ each call overrides
      the previous calls.  If you want to iteratively add Bcc: recipients, use the <samp class="codeph">addBcc()</samp> method.
    </div>
