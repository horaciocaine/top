  <div>
      <p>
    Headers are retrieved through the HeaderSet's <samp class="codeph">get()</samp> and <samp class="codeph">getAll()</samp>
    methods.
  </p>

      <div class="section">
         <p>
        To get a header, or several headers from a MIME entity:
      </p>

      </div>

      <ol>
         <li>
            <span>
          Get the HeaderSet from the entity by via its <samp class="codeph">getHeaders()</samp>
          method.
        </span>
         </li>

         <li>
            <span>
          Get the header(s) from the HeaderSet by calling either <samp class="codeph">get()</samp>
          or <samp class="codeph">getAll()</samp>.
        </span>
         </li>

      </ol>

    
      <div class="section">
         <p>
        When using <samp class="codeph">get()</samp> a single header is returned that matches the
        name (case insensitive) that is passed to it.  When using <samp class="codeph">getAll()</samp>
        with a header name, an array of headers with that name are returned.  Calling
        <samp class="codeph">getAll()</samp> with no arguments returns an array of all headers present
        in the entity.
      </p>

      
         <div class="note">
            <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        It's valid for some headers to appear more than once in a message (e.g. the Received header).
        For this reason <samp class="codeph">getAll()</samp> exists to fetch all headers with a specified name.
        In addition, <samp class="codeph">get()</samp> accepts an optional numerical index, starting from zero
        to specify which header you want more specifically.
      </div>


         <div class="note">
            <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        If you want to modify the contents of the header and you don't know for sure what type of
        header it is (see <a href="header-types"
               title="Because all headers are modeled on different data (dates, addresses, textâ€¦) there are different types of Header in Swift Mailer. Swift Mailer attempts to categorize all possible MIME headers into more general groups, defined by a small number of classes.">Header Types</a>) then you may need to
        check the type by calling its <samp class="codeph">getFieldType()</samp> method.
