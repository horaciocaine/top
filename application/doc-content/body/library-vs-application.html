    Swift Mailer is not an application â€“ it's a library.
  </p>

      <p>
      To most experienced developers this is probably an obvious point to make, but it's certainly
      worth mentioning.  Many people often contact me having gotten the completely wrong end of the
      stick in terms of what Swift Mailer is actually for.
    </p>

      <p>
      It's not an application.  It does not have a graphical user interface.  It cannot be opened
      in your web browser directly.
    </p>

      <p>
      It's a library (or a framework if you like).  It provides a whole lot of classes that do some
      very complicated things, so that you don't have to.  You "use" Swift Mailer within an application
      so that your application can have the ability to send emails.
    </p>

      <p>
      The component-based structure of the library means that you are free to implement it in a number
      of different ways and that you can pick and choose what you want to use.
    </p>

      <p>
      An application on the other hand (such as a blog or a forum) is already "put together" in a
      particular way, (usually) provides a graphical user interface and most likely doesn't offer a
      great deal of integration with your own application.
    </p>

      <p>
      Embrace the structure of the library and use the components it offers to your advantage.  Learning
      what the components do, rather than blindly copying and pasting existing code will put you in a
      great position to build a powerful application!
