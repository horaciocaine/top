    You only need to upload the "lib/" directory to your web host for production use.  All other
    files and directories are support files not needed in production.

        You will need FTP, rsync or similar software installed in order to upload the "lib/" directory
        to your web host.

        To upload Swift Mailer:
      </p>

      </div>

      <ol>
         <li>
            <span>
          Open your FTP program, or a command line if you prefer rsync/scp.
        </span>
         </li>

         <li>
            <span>
          Upload the "lib/" directory to your hosting account.
        </span>
         </li>

      </ol>

         <p>
        The files needed to use Swift Mailer should now be accessible to PHP on your host.
      </p>

         <p>
        The following example shows show you can upload the files using <span class="cmdname">rsync</span> on Linux or OS X.
      </p>

         <div class="note">
            <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        You do not need to place the files inside your web root. They only need to be in a place
        where your PHP scripts can "include" them.
