    The <samp class="codeph">send()</samp> method of the <samp class="codeph">Swift_Mailer</samp> class
    sends a message using exactly the same logic as your Desktop mail client would
    use.  Just pass it a Messgae and get a result.

          <samp class="codeph">Swift_MailTransport</samp> or one of the aggregate Transports.

         <li>
            <span>
          Create an instance of the <samp class="codeph">Swift_Mailer</samp> class, using the Transport
          as it's constructor parameter.

        The message will be sent just like it would
        be sent if you used your mail client.  An integer is returned which includes the
        number of successful recipients.  If none of the recipients could be sent to then
        zero will be returned, which equates to a boolean <samp class="codeph">false</samp>.  If you
        set two <samp class="codeph">To:</samp> recipients and three <samp class="codeph">Bcc:</samp> recipients in
        the message and all of the recipients are delivered to successfully then the value
        5 will be returned.

         <div class="note">
            <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        In the following example, one is email is sent to both <samp class="codeph">receiver@domain.org</samp>
        and <samp class="codeph">other@domain.org</samp>.  Both addresses will be visible in the <samp class="codeph">To:</samp>
        header.  If you don't want <samp class="codeph">receiver@domain.org</samp> and <samp class="codeph">other@domain.org</samp>
        to know about each other you should use <samp class="codeph">batchSend()</samp> instead.
