  <h1 class="topictitle1">Attaching Existing Files</h1>

  
  
  <div>
      <p>
    Files that already exist, either on disk or at a URL can be attached to a message
    with just one line of code, using Swift_Attachment::fromPath().
  </p>

      <div class="section">
         <p>
        You can attach files that exist locally, or if your PHP installation has
        <samp class="codeph">allow_url_fopen</samp> turned on you can attach files from other
        websites.
      </p>

         <p>
        To attach an existing file:
      </p>

      </div>

      <ol>
         <li>
            <span>
          Create an attachment with <samp class="codeph">Swift_Attachment::fromPath()</samp>.
        </span>
         </li>

         <li>
            <span>
          Add the attachment to the message with <samp class="codeph">attach()</samp>.
        </span>
         </li>

      </ol>

    
      <div class="section">
         <p>
        The attachment will be presented to the recipient as a downloadable file
        with the same filename as the one you attached.
      </p>

      </div>

    
      <div class="example" id="attaching-files__attach_frompath">
         <pre class="kodify php">
//Create the attachment
// * Note that you can technically leave the content-type parameter out
$attachment = Swift_Attachment::fromPath('/path/to/image.jpg', 'image/jpeg');  

//Attach it to the message
$message-&gt;attach($attachment);


//The two statements above could be written in one line instead
$message-&gt;attach(Swift_Attachment::fromPath('/path/to/image.jpg'));


//You can attach files from a URL if allow_url_fopen is on in php.ini
$message-&gt;attach(Swift_Attachment::fromPath('http://site.tld/logo.png'));
</pre>
