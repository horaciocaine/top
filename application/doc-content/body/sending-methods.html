  <h1 class="topictitle1">Available Methods for Sending Messages</h1>

  
  
  <div>
<p>
    The Mailer class offers two methods for sending Messages –
    <samp class="codeph">send()</samp> and <samp class="codeph">batchSend()</samp>.  Each behaves in a slightly
    different way.
  </p>

    <p>
      When a message is sent in Swift Mailer, the Mailer class communicates with whichever
      Transport class you have chosen to use (see <a href="transport-types" title="A Transport is the component which actually does the sending. You need to provide a Transport object to the Mailer class and there are several possible options.">Transport Types</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Each recipient in the message should either be accepted or rejected by the Transport.  For example,
      if the domain name on the email address is not reachable the SMTP Transport may reject the address
      because it cannot process it.  Whichever method you use – <samp class="codeph">send()</samp> or
      <samp class="codeph">batchSend()</samp> – Swift Mailer will return an integer indicating the number
      of accepted recipients.
    </p>

      It's possible to find out which recipients were rejected – we'll cover that later in this chapter.

<a href="send-method">Using the send() Method</a>
<br/>
The send() method of the Swift_Mailer class sends a message using exactly the same logic as your Desktop mail client would use. Just pass it a Messgae and get a result.</li>
<li class="olchildlink">
<a href="batchsend-method">Using the batchSend() Method</a>
<br/>
The batchSend() method of the Swift_Mailer class sends a separate message to each recipient in the To: field. Each recipient receives a message containing only their own address in the To: field.</li>
