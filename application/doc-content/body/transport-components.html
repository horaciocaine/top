      <p>
    Transports are the classes in Swift Mailer that are responsible for communicating
    with a service in order to deliver a Message. There are several types of Transport
    in Swift Mailer, all of which implement the Swift_Transport interface and offer
    underlying start(), stop() and send() methods.

         <p>
        Typically you will not need to know how a Transport works under-the-surface, you will only need
        to know how to create an instance of one, and which one to use for your environment.
