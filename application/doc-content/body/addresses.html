  <div>
      <p>
    Addresses are specified with a basic array syntax that can include the name
    associated with the address.
  </p>

      <div class="section" id="message-addresses__syntax">
         <h2 class="sectiontitle">Syntax for Addresses</h2>
      
         <p>
        If you only wish to refer to a single email address (for example your <samp class="codeph">From:</samp>
        address) then you can just use a string.
      </p>

         <pre class="codeblock">
$message-&gt;setFrom('some@address.tld');
</pre>


         <p>
        If you want to include a name then you must use an associative array.
      </p>

         <pre class="codeblock">
$message-&gt;setFrom(array('some@address.tld' =&gt; 'The Name'));
</pre>


         <p>
        If you want to include multiple addresses then you must use an array.
      </p>

         <pre class="codeblock">
$message-&gt;setTo(array('some@address.tld', 'other@address.tld'));
</pre>


         <p>
        You can mix personalized (addresses with a name) and non-personalized
        addresses in the same list by mixing the use of associative and non-associative
        array syntax.
      </p>


         <pre class="codeblock">
$message-&gt;setTo(array(
  'recipient-with-name@example.org' =&gt; 'Recipient Name One',
  'no-name@example.org', //Note that this is not a key-value pair
  'named-recipient@example.org' =&gt; 'Recipient Name Two'
));
</pre>

      
      </div>
