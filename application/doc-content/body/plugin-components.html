  <div>
<p>
    Plugins exist to extend, or modify the behaviour of Swift Mailer.  They respond to Events
    that are fired within the Transports during sending.

    <div class="section" id="plugins__about">
      <p>
        There are a number of Plugins provided as part of the base Swift Mailer package
        and they all follow a common interface to respond to Events fired within the
        library.  Interfaces are provided to "listen" to each type of Event fired and
        to act as desired when a listened-to Event occurs.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        Although several plugins are provided with Swift Mailer out-of-the-box, the Events system has been
        specifically designed to make it easy for experienced object-oriented developers to write their
        own plugins in order to achieve goals that may not be possible with the base library.
