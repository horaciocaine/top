<p>
    A <samp class="codeph">Sender:</samp> address specifies who sent the message and is set with the
    <samp class="codeph">setSender()</samp> method of the message.

        The <samp class="codeph">Sender:</samp> address is visible in the message headers and will
        be seen by the recipients.
      </p>

      <p>
        This address will be used as the <samp class="codeph">Return-Path:</samp> unless otherwise
        specified.

      <div class="note">
<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        If you set multiple <samp class="codeph">From:</samp> addresses then you absolutely must
        set a <samp class="codeph">Sender:</samp> address to indicate who physically sent the message.

      <div class="note" id="setting-sender__single_sender">
<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        You must not set more than one sender address on a message because it's not
        possible for more than one person to send a single message.
