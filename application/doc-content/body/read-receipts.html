    It is possible to request a read-receipt to be sent to an address when the email
    is opened.  To request a read receipt set the address with <samp class="codeph">setReadReceiptTo()</samp>.

        Read receipts won't work for the majority of recipients since many mail clients

        aware that one has been requested.
