  <h1 class="topictitle1">History of Swift Mailer</h1>

  
  
  <div>
<p>
    Swift Mailer began back in 2005 as a one-class project for sending mail over SMTP.  It has since grown
    into the flexible component-based library that is in development today.
  </p>

    <p>
      I first posted Swift Mailer on a web forum at <a href="http://forums.devnetwork.net">http://forums.devnetwork.net</a>
      asking for comments from other developers.  It was never intended as a fully supported open source
      project, but members of the forum began to adopt it and make use of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Very quickly feature requests were coming to me for the ability to add attachments and use SMTP authentication,
      along with a number of other "obvious" missing features.  Considering the only alternative was PHPMailer it seemed
      like a good time to bring some fresh tools to the table.  I began working towards a more component based, PHP5-like
      approach unlike the existing single-class, legacy PHP4 approach taken by PHPMailer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Members of the forum offered a lot of advice and critique on my code as I worked through this project and released
      versions 2 and 3 of the library in 2005 and 2006, which by then had been broken down into smaller classes offering
      more flexibility and supporting plugins.  To this day I still receive a lot of feature requests from users both on the
      forum and in my inbox.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have learned a lot over the years whilst working on Swift Mailer and I believe that I have matured a lot as a developer,
      improving the underlying code in the library as I have done so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Until 2008 I was the sole developer of Swift Mailer, but entering 2009 I gained the support of two experienced
      developers well-known to me: Paul Annesley and Christopher Thompson.  This has been an extremely welcome change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now 2009 and in its fourth major version Swift Mailer is more object-oriented and flexible than ever, both from a usability
      standpoint and from a development standpoint.
    </p>

    <p>
      By no means is Swift Mailer ready to call "finished".  There are still many features that can be added to the library
      along with the constant refactoring that happens behind the scenes.
