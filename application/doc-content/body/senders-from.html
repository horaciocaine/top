  <div>
<p>
    A <samp class="codeph">From:</samp> address is required and is set with the
    <samp class="codeph">setFrom()</samp> method of the message.
  </p>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        <samp class="codeph">From:</samp> addresses specify who actually wrote the email, and usually
        who sent it.
      </p>

      <p>
        What most people probably don't realise is that you can have more than one <samp class="codeph">From:</samp>
        address if more than one person wrote the email â€“ for example if an email was put together

        <span>
          Call the <samp class="codeph">setFrom()</samp> method on the Message.

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        The <samp class="codeph">From:</samp> address(es) are visible in the message headers and will
        be seen by the recipients.
      </p>

      <div class="note" id="setting-from__multiple_from">
<span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        If you set multiple <samp class="codeph">From:</samp> addresses then you absolutely must
        set a <samp class="codeph">Sender:</samp> address to indicate who physically sent the message.
