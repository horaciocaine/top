    Many SMTP servers have limits on the number of messages that may be sent
    during any single SMTP connection.  The AntiFlood plugin provides a way to
    stay within this limit while still managing a large number of emails.
  </p>

      <p>
      A typical limit for a single connection is 100 emails.  If the server you
      connect to imposes such a limit, it expects you to disconnect after that
      number of emails has been sent.  You could manage this manually within a
      loop, but the AntiFlood plugin provides the necessary wrapper code so that
      you don't need to worry about this logic.
    </p>

    
      <p>
      Regardless of limits imposed by the server, it's usually a good idea to
      be conservative with the resources of the SMTP server.  Sending will
      become sluggish if the server is being over-used so using the AntiFlood
      plugin will not be a bad idea even if no limits exist.
    </p>

    
      <p>
      The AntiFlood plugin's logic is basically to disconnect and the immediately
      re-connect with the SMTP server every X number of emails sent, where X
      is a number you specify to the plugin.
    </p>

    
      <p>
      You can also specify a time period in seconds that Swift Mailer should pause
      for between the disconnect/re-connect process.  It's a good idea to pause
      for a short time (say 30 seconds every 100 emails) simply to give the SMTP
      server a chance to process its queue and recover some resources.

The AntiFlood Plugin – like all plugins – is added with the Mailer class' registerPlugin() method. It takes two constructor parameters: the number of emails to pause after, and optionally the number of seconds to pause for.</li>
