<p>
    If your SMTP server has restrictions in place to limit the rate at which you send
    emails, then your code will need to be aware of this rate-limiting.  The Throttler
    plugin makes Swift Mailer run at a rate-limited speed.
  </p>

    <p>
      Many shared hosts don't open their SMTP servers as a free-for-all.  Usually they
      have policies in place (probably to discourage spammers) that only allow you
      to send a fixed number of emails per-hour/day.
    </p>

    
    <p>
      The Throttler plugin supports two modes of rate-limiting and with each, you
      will need to do that math to figure out the values you want.  The plugin can
      limit based on the number of emails per minute, or the number of bytes-transferred
      per-minute.

The Throttler Plugin – like all plugins – is added with the Mailer class' registerPlugin() method. It has two required constructor parameters that tell it how to do its rate-limiting.</li>
