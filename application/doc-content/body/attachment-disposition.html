      <p>
    Attachments just appear as files that can be saved to the Desktop if desired.
    You can make attachment appear inline where possible by using the setDisposition()
    method of an attachment.

      <div class="section">
         <p>
        To make an attachment appear inline:
      </p>

      </div>

    
      <div class="p">
        <span>
          Call its <samp class="codeph">setDisposition()</samp> method.
        </span>
      </div>

    
    
      <div class="section">
         <p>
        The attachment will be displayed within the email viewing window if the mail
        client knows how to display it.
      </p>

         <div class="note">
            <span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
        If you try to create an inline attachment for a non-displayable file type such as a
        ZIP file, the mail client should just present the attachment as normal.
