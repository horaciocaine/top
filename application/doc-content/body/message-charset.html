  <h1 class="topictitle1">Setting the Character Set</h1>

  
  
  <div>
      <p>
    The character set of the message (and it's MIME parts) is set with the setCharset() method.
    You can also change the global default of UTF-8 by working with the Swift_Preferences class.
  </p>

      <div class="section">
         <p>
        Swift Mailer will default to the UTF-8 character set unless otherwise overridden.  UTF-8
        will work in most instances since it includes all of the standard US keyboard characters
        in addition to most international characters.
      </p>

         <p>
        It is absolutely vital however that you know what character set your message (or it's MIME parts)
        are written in otherwise your message may be received completely garbled.
      </p>

         <div class="p">
        There are two places in Swift Mailer where you can change the character set:
        
        <br/>
            <ol>
               <li>In the Swift_Preferences class</li>

               <li>On each individual message and/or MIME part</li>

            </ol>

         </div>

         <p>
        To set the character set of your Message:
      </p>

      </div>

      <ul>
         <li>
            <span>
          Change the global UTF-8 setting by calling <samp class="codeph">Swift_Preferences::setCharset()</samp>; or
        </span>
         </li>

         <li>
            <span>
          Call the <samp class="codeph">setCharset()</samp> method on the message or the MIME part.
        </span>
         </li>

      </ul>

    
      <div class="example" id="setting-charset__setcharset">
         <h2 class="sectiontitle">Setting the Charset</h2>
      
         <pre class="kodify php">
//Approach 1: Change the global setting (suggested)
Swift_Preferences::getInstance()-&gt;setCharset('iso-8859-2');

//Approach 2: Call the setCharset() method of the message
$message = Swift_Message::newInstance()
  -&gt;setCharset('iso-8859-2');
  
//Apprach 3: Specify the charset when setting the body
$message-&gt;setBody('My body', 'text/html', 'iso-8859-2');

//Approach 4: Specify the charset for each part added
$message-&gt;addPart('My part', 'text/plain', 'iso-8859-2');
