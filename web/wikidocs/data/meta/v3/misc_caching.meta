Composing emails is a tough business.  You need to encode files, correct line endings, translate to formats laid out in the RFCs.  It's therefore easier if you can just do this once and once it's been done, re-use the results.  Swift caches various pieces of data (computed strings) on various different levels whilst it composes messages.  This is all handled by an abstracted caching layer.";}s:8:"internal";a:2:{s:5:"cache";b:1;s:3:"toc";b:1;}}s:10:"persistent";a:3:{s:4:"date";a:1:{s:7:"created";i:1172361935;}s:7:"creator";s:12:"Chris Corbyn";s:11:"last_change";b:0;}}
