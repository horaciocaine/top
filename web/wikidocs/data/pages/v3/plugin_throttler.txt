====== Throttler Plugin to restrict the speed ======

If you want to run a batch send that's going to take a long time and don't want to hog the server's resources and/or bandwidth in the process perhaps this plugin is the solution.  Unlike the AntiFlood plugin, which offers a similar solution, the throttler works on the basis of restricting speed, not on the basis of minimizing the number of emails per-connection.

You can set the speed in terms of bytes-per-minute or in terms of messages-per-minute.

**NOTE:** Bytes-per-minute applies only to the outgoing traffic, but the incoming traffic negligible anyway (basic one-line responses)

Using the plugin is simple.  Just create it, set the rate and then load it :)

<code php>
<?php

require_once "lib/Swift.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Connection/SMTP.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Plugin/Throttler.php";

$swift =& new Swift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP("smtp.host.tld"));

$throttler =& new Swift_Plugin_Throttler();
$throttler->setBytesPerMinute(20000000); //Roughly 20MB

$swift->attachPlugin($throttler, "throttler");

//or maybe you want to set the number of messages per minute?

$throttler->setEmailsPerMinute(30); //Max of 1 email every 2 seconds
$swift->attachPlugin($throttler, "throttler");
</code>

This will work no matter what approach you take to send your emails, be it batchSend() or send().
