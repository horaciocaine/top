====== Requesting a Read-Receipt ======

Read-Receipts are not very reliable since most emails clients will either prompt, or block them.  However, if you do desire to request a read-receipt you should set this in the message itself, before sending:

<code php>
$message =& new Swift_Message("My subject", "My body");
$message->requestReadReceipt("your@address.tld");
