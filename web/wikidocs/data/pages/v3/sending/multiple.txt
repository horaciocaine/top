====== Sending to mulitple recipients ======

Sending to multiple recipients, or including Cc and Bcc recipients is handled by passing an instance of Swift_RecipientList as the recipient parameter in send().

Swift_RecipientList() contains the methods addTo(), addCc() and addBcc() along with removeTo(), removeCc() etc.

<code php>
require_once "lib/Swift.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Connection/SMTP.php";

$swift =& new Swift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP("host.tld"));

$message =& new Swift_Message("My subject", "My body");

$recipients =& new Swift_RecipientList();
$recipients->addTo("foo@bar.com", "Foo Bar");
$recipients->addCc("zip@button.com", "Zip Button");

$swift->send($message, $recipients, new Swift_Address("me@address.tld", "Me"));
</code>

When you send to multiple ''To:'' recipients in this way, all recipients will see each other's addresses in the ''To:'' field.  If you're sending out a batch email for marketing purposes, or a newsletter then you will want to perform the same process, but replace send() with [[v3:tutorials:batch|batchSend()]].
