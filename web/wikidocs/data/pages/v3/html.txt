====== Sending a HTML E-Mail ======

Sending a HTML email with Swift is just as easy as sending a plain-text email.  You just need to tell the Message that's it's in HTML format and everything else is the same as if you were sending plain-text.  HTML has it's advantages in that it's easy to create a layout with images and styles, but not all mail clients will read it, and if you're not careful, you might be increasing the risk of being blocked as spam.  See [[v3:tips_spam]].

A common pitfall is that people forget you need to use ''<br />'' tags in place of real line breaks in HTML emails.  I have had numerous support requests asking why everything was coming out on one line in the past ;)

<code php>
<?php

require_once "lib/Swift/Swift.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Connection/SMTP.php";

$swift =& new Swift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP("server.tld", 25));

$message =& new Swift_Message("Some subject", "Your message <u>here</u>", "text/html");

if ($swift->send($message, "recipient@domain.tld", "you@home.tld"))
{
    echo "Message sent";
}
else
{
    echo "Message failed to send";
}

//It's polite to do this when you're finished
$swift->disconnect();

</code>

You can alternatively set the text/html type on the message by using the following method:

<code php>
$message =& new Swift_Message("Some subject", "Message goes here");
$message->setContentType("text/html");
</code>
