====== Sending a message to a recipient ======

Sending messages in Swift is extremely simple.  You call the send() method, which only has 3 parameters.  One is the message, one is the recipient, and the other is the sender.

<code php>
$swift =& new Swift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP("host.tld"));

$message =& new Swift_Message("My subject", "My body");

$sent = $swift->send($message, "recipient@address.tld", "sender@address.tld");
echo "Sent to $sent recipients";

</code>

send() returns the number of recipients it delivered to message to successfully.

In the above example we used strings for the email addresses, however, using the Swift_Address class we have a little more flexibility over the format of the address.  We can have a personal name in the address like so: ''Foo <foo@bar.com>''.

<code php>
$swift =& new Swift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP("host.tld"));

$message =& new Swift_Message("My subject", "My body");

$sent = $swift->send($message, new Swift_Address("recipient@address.tld", "Recipient"), "sender@address.tld");
echo "Sent to $sent recipients";
</code>

We can also use the Swift_Address class for the sender parameter:

<code php>
$swift =& new Swift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP("host.tld"));

$message =& new Swift_Message("My subject", "My body");


$sent = $swift->send(
    $message, new Swift_Address("recipient@address.tld", "Recipient Name"),
    new Swift_Address("sender@address.tld", "My Name"));
echo "Sent to $sent recipients";
</code>

Simple right? :)
