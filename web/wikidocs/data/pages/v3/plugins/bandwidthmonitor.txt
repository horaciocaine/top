====== Swift Bandwidth Monitoring/Tracking Plugin ======

Depending upon what you're doing, or shoud I say, the scale of what you're sending you may wish to keep track of how much bandwidth Swift is using.  This plugin measures the incoming and outgoing bandwidth through the connection.

**NOTE:** The figures are from Swift's point of view, not the server.  "Bytes in" refers to bytes from the SMTP server back into swift; "bytes out" refers to bytes sent from Swift to the SMTP server.

All you need to do is load the plugin and grab the figures at runtime.

<code php>
<?php

require_once "lib/Swift.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Connection/SMTP.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Plugin/BandwidthMonitor.php";

//Instantiate Swift
$swift =& new Swift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP("smtp.host.tld"));

//Create the instance of the plugin
$bandwidth =& new Swift_Plugin_BandwidthMonitor();

//Load it
$swift->attachPlugin($bandwidth, "bwmon");

$message = new Swift_Message( ... whatever ... );

foreach ($some_recipients as $address)
{
    $swift->send($message, $address, $your_address);
    echo "Bytes sent out so far: " . $bandwidth->getBytesOut() . "<br />";
    echo "Bytes received so far: " . $bandwidth->getBytesIn() . "<br />";
}
</code>

You can reset the counters at any point by calling for example:

<code php>
$bandwidth->setBytesIn(0);
$bandwidth->setBytesOut(0);
