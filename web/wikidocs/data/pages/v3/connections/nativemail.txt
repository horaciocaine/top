====== Swift_Connection_NativeMail ======

**__Synopsis:__** //''new Swift_Connection_NativeMail( void )''//

This is probably the simplest of all the connections to get to grips with.  It uses PHP's [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mail.php|mail() function]].  It takes no constructor parameters and requires no configuration.

**NOTE:** Due to differences between [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mail.php|mail()]] in Windows and mail() on UNIX-like systems there will be small inconsistencies between running this connection on Windows and Linux/OS X.  These are perfectly fine.

**NOTE2:** If you use this connection you will not be able to run custom SMTP commands, for obvious reasons ;)

<code php>
require_once "lib/Swift.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Connection/NativeMail.php";

$swift =& new Swift(new Swift_Connection_NativeMail());
</code>

As of version 3.2.5, you can specify what the 5th parameter of mail() is structured like by passing it to the constructor.  By default this is "-oi -f %s" where %s is replaced with the actual sender address using sprintf().  You can specify your own string by doing this for example.

<code php>
require_once "lib/Swift.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Connection/NativeMail.php";

$swift =& new Swift(new Swift_Connection_NativeMail("-f%s"));
</code>

**NOTE:** The above will only have any affect if safe_mode is turned //off// in php.ini.
