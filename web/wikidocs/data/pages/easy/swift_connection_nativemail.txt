====== Swift_Connection_NativeMail ======

**__Synopsis:__** //''new Swift_Connection_NativeMail( void )''//

This is probably the simplest of all the connections to get to grips with.  It uses PHP's [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mail.php|mail() function]].  It takes no constructor parameters and requires no configuration.

**NOTE:** Due to differences between [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mail.php|mail()]] in Windows and mail() on UNIX-like systems there will be small inconsistencies between running this connection on Windows and Linux/OS X.  These are perfectly fine.

**NOTE2:** If you use this connection you will not be able to run custom SMTP commands, for obvious reasons ;)

<code php>
require_once "lib/EasySwift.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Connection/NativeMail.php";

$swift =& new EasySwift(new Swift_Connection_NativeMail());
