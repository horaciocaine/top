===== Getting connected to SMTP =====

The SMTP connection is probably the most heavily used connection, and almost certainly the most consistent and portable.  This connection opens up a socket with TCP and speaks "SMTP" to a remote SMTP server.  You need to have a SMTP server which is capable of relaying mail from the domain of your web server for this to work.  Some hosts provide a SMTP server for you as part of your package.  You may also make use of Gmail's SMTP server if you have a Gmail account; however, they do impose a maximum limit of 50 emails in any one go.

<code php>
require_once "lib/EasySwift.php";
require_once "lib/Swift/Connection/SMTP.php";

//Connect to localhost on port 25
$swift =& new EasySwift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP("localhost"));


//Connect to an IP address on a non-standard port
$swift =& new EasySwift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP("217.147.94.117", 419));

//Connect to Gmail
$swift =& new EasySwift(new Swift_Connection_SMTP(
    "smtp.gmail.com", SWIFT_SECURE_PORT, SWIFT_TLS));

</code>

Note that you can also use the constants provided by swift itself.  See the [[v3:start|Swift Mailer Version 3 Documentation]] for more information.

The default timeout to wait for a connection, or to wait for a response with the SMTP connection is 15 seconds.  This can be adjusted by using the setTimeout() method.

<code php>
$smtp =& new Swift_Connection_SMTP("some-host.tld", 25);
$smtp->setTimeout(2);


$swift =& new Swift($smtp);

</code>
