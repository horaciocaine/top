====== Send me your ideas and thoughts ======

Come on guys, lets do this together, give me some input and let me know what's lacking in version 3, or if something stinks about my direction with version 4.

One thing though, don't ask for anything to do with receiving mail or tracking delivery once a message has been sent, that's a complete different subject which Swift has never been scoped towards.  Swift is an email creation and delivery library, not a complete email system ;)
