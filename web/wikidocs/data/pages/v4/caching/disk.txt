===== The Disk Cache =====

The Disk cache is enabled by default, provided ''sys_get_temp_dir()'' exists.  Using disk caching provides speed improvements when sending large attachments and it provides a consistent level of memory use (roughly 1.68 MiB).

To explicitly use disk caching place these lines anywhere before you send any messages.  There is no need to use this code in the same script multiple times; only call it once.

<code php>
<?php

Swift_Preferences::getInstance()->setCacheType('disk')->setTempDir('/tmp');
</code>

Where "/tmp" is replaced with whatever writable directory exists on your server.
