<p>

99.9% of the time the best approach to doing this is to store all the emails and recipients in a database with a field marked as “unsent”. A cron script can run every few minutes pulling out more modest batch sizes of around 100 emails, then flagging those as “sent”.

<p>
There are plugins such as AntiFlood and Throttler to aid in large batch sending but there&#039;s no substitute for running regular smaller batches.

<p>
I have also taken the approach of running a command line <acronym title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> script in the background with a perpetual while() loop int it, sleeping for a few seconds at the end of each loop.  This mimmicks cron&#039;s behaviour except that new processes are not spawned since the script runs once only.  Each iteration of the loop can pull out 50-100 emails and send them.
</p>

<p>
If you really do have an extremely large number of emails to send you&#039;ll almost certainly have to pay for a <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> server, preferably several otherwise you&#039;re effectively going to DoS somebody else&#039;s server ;)
