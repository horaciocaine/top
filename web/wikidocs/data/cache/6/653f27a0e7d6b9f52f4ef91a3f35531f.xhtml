 <strong>Synopsis:</strong> <code><em>new Swift_Plugin_AntiFlood([int threshold [, int pause]])</em></code>
</p>

<p>
The AntiFlood plugin is designed to help lessen the load on the <acronym title="Hyper Text Transfer Protocol">HTTP</acronym> server and the <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> server.  It can also be used to send out very large batches of emails when the <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> server has restrictions in place to limit the number of emails sent in one go.
</p>

<p>
The plugin is given a threshold number of emails to allow through per-connection.  It then keeps a persistent connection open for that number of emails and restarts the connection each time that threshold is reached.  This plugin has been used with great success by a large number of developers sending out many thousands of emails over <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym>.  It can be used with any of the available connectons - not just <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym>.
</p>

<p>
Not only does this plugin keep closing and restarting the connection when the threshold is reached, it also is capable of waiting for a given number of seconds before the connection is re-opened.  Even just a few seconds will give the servers a considerable chance to flush some memory and will likely give you a faster overall result compared with not using a pause.
