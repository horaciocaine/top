<p>
 The message priority does little more than flag the message in the recipients INBOX as being important or not.  To set the priority, you make a change to the message itself.  You can provide an integer ranging from 1 (High) to 5 (Low) to indicate the priority.  By default, no priority is indicated which equates to a priority of 3 (Normal).  The class constants used in the example below map to the relevant integer values of the priority.
</p>

<p>
PRIORITY_HIGH = 1 PRIORITY_NORMAL = 3 PRIORITY_LOW = 5
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> PHP4 does not support class constants so instead there are some global constants provided: SWIFT_MESSAGE_PRIORITY_LOW, SWIFT_MESSAGE_PRIORITY_NORMAL, SWIFT_MESSAGE_PRIORITY_HIGH.
