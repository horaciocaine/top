</p>

<p>
Sendmail is a binary executable which runs on UNIX-like systems such as Linux and <acronym title="Operating System">OS</acronym> X.  The Swift_Connection_Sendmail class runs this executable in a standalone <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> mode and sends emails through it.  If you have sendmail available to you this will be much faster than using the <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> connection to a remote server, however, it does have one drawback - load balancing.  If you use sendmail then your server is processing Swift instructions, and also sending out email directly.  Using <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> on the other hand spreads the load across two servers - hint hint! ;)
</p>

<p>
Although using sendmail will make your script end faster, it&rsquo;s a common misconception that the email is going to be delivered faster.  Throw away any such misconceptions now.  Sendmail &ldquo;spools&rdquo; emails which means that they sit in a queue.  Typically it runs a batch off the queue every 15 minutes.  The rest of the process is <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym>, just like what would have happened if you&rsquo;d used the <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> connection in the first place.
</p>

<p>
By default, the Sendmail connection will try to use a binary at /usr/sbin/sendmail with the &ldquo;-bs&rdquo; flags set.  If your sendmail installation is found in another path you will need to inform the connection of its location by passing it as a constructor parameter.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> When passing a value to the constructor, you must include the &ldquo;-bs&rdquo; flags, or flags which invoke the same behaviour in your version of sendmail.  Support for &ldquo;-t&rdquo; is experimental and is NOT officially supported.
</p>

<p>
<strong>NOTE2:</strong> Even though this connection is named Sendmail it does work with other binary MTAs such as qMail, Postfix and Exim provided they can operate in <acronym title="Simple Mail Transfer Protocol">SMTP</acronym> mode.

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> To use auto-detection in PHP5 you use the class constant <code>Swift_Connection_Sendmail::AUTO_DETECT</code>.  PHP4 does not support class constants so instead, a global constant <code>SWIFT_SENDMAIL_AUTO_DETECT</code> is provided.
</p>

<p>
Once a connection is established with sendmail you can use Swift in the same way as you&rsquo;d use any of the other connections.
</p>

<p>
<strong>For the curious:</strong> Feel free to experiment with using this connection with the &ldquo;-t&rdquo; flag set, but be aware that this probably not work very well and is not yet (if ever) officially supported.
</p>

<p>
By default, the sendmail connection will time out after 10 seconds if the process takes a long time to respond.  This can be adjusted using the setTimeout() method:
</p>
<pre class="code php"><span class="re0">$sendmail</span> =&amp; <span class="kw2">new</span> Swift_Connection_Sendmail<span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span>;
