This is more than likely die to a firewall rule that has been put in place by your hosting provider.  Though I have not verified this information I have also been informed that PhpSuExec can cuase problems establishing socket connections.

The error comes from fsockopen(), not from Swift directly.  You should contact your hosting provider for further help.
