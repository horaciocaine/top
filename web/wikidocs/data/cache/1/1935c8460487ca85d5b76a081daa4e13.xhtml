When you send a <acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> format email you can of course include the <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> tag.  Commonly, people will do something like:

</p>
<pre class="code">&lt;img src=&quot;http://your-host.tld/images/foo.png&quot; alt=&quot;foo&quot; /&gt;</pre>

<p>

However, because this links to a remote image you may find that your recipient does not see the image as the mail client may block remote images by default.  If you&#039;d prefer to send the image as part of the email you need to embed it.

This does have it&#039;s drawbacks however.  Some web-based email services like Yahoo <em>may</em> not display the image, and additonally, you will use extra bandwidth in sending the email.
